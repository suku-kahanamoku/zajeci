			"history": "Moravian and Czech wines are gaining increasing popularity not only here but also worldwide. In the Czech Republic, over 50 varieties are grown, thanks to the diversity and ruggedness of the terrain. Each region contributes specific characteristics to individual varieties, so everyone can choose the best wine for themselves. Explore quality wines from Moravia and Bohemia and discover the beauty through a wine glass.",
			"history2": "The typical character of the wines is similar to Tramín Red variety wines, but the spicy fullness is usually lower, and on the contrary, the acidity is somewhat higher. However, it is necessary to maintain acidity for a pleasant finish. Wines are usually golden-yellow in color, with Tramín aromatic substances in the aroma, namely roses, complemented by vanilla tones; the taste is full, long-lasting, with a gentler harmony than Tramín. In aroma and taste, we can find spices, nutmeg, vanilla, tangerines."
